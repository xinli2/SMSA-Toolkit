The term metaverse become more popular since facebook announced they will focus on their own metaverse. The actual usable metaverse is still far, far away. For most people, metaverse is still limited to roblox or similar game.  As for NTF, as for now it's just a hype. I have no doubt it will go down sooner or later. Considering the actual use of the technology, the system will actually become useful & more common. It's basically a marketplace system after all. Maybe several art will still be sold for high amount of money.  Is it a scam? It is as much scam as the plant or gem stone trend. People are free to make money of it.

Like free money? Or free skins? Or even free packs? And why? What would you do with it if you have received it?  Games can be anything from mobile app to online server ie: - Roblox - Minecraft - Fornite - Brawl Stars - League of Legends - Grand Theft Auto - Asphalt 9: Legends - Apex Legends - Animal Crossing: New Horizons - FIFA 20 etc.   During lockdown last year, I got stuck into Roblox due to boredom. At first I thought ""Who cares about Robux! I don't need them since there are many games that are free and you can still have free clothes and accessories (but not many!)."" But after playing this for over a year, I started feeling annoyed that you had to pay for Robux and you couldn't earn it either.  So if I had the chance, I would want to receive $350 gift card from Roblox. Yes, it's indeed quite a lot, but I am going to spend at least 32% on VIPs/Premium, 38% on clothing, and the rest I'll save it up for something else that in fact I'm not sure yet...","Oct 3, 2021 at 12:05 AM","Sep 8, 2021",73,60,Link

I like MMOs even though I didn't play one in a while now, if anything for free that I want in them it would be... maybe certain items that are required for crafting something? like some items that need to be crafted need some items that can be acquired from monsters or NPCs in the game and other items from the game store, it can get annoying sometimes wanting to craft something but you can't because you need to buy its components first, so, maybe, receiving those items? not sure tbh, free stuff while good but in such games it can ruin the fun, so, maybe it is not a good idea, don't know XD","Oct 3, 2021 at 12:25 AM",,,,Link
