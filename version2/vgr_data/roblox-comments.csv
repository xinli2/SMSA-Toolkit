Capcom may be milking the franchise, but they are doing a good job in the sense that they are making games fans seem to love. Yeah there are a minority of people making a fuss about the new games, but from what I have seen, most fans are cool with all of the games that have been coming out.      That's what business is for them, as long as it sell, keep making it till it no longer have value in the eyes of consumers. It's not only Capcom that does that, EA is very notable with doing that as well with their ridiculously selling of FIFA. It's the most overrated game that keeps selling more than it should today in my opinion.          Candy Stick        1",2022-08-03T14:29:09Z

I paid about 1000 yen for it (about 8$) so that was a good deal, glad i held off on it.      I also like my videogame books so these are the ones i picked up the last couple of months, i do have to say the dreamcast collected works dissapointed me a little as it's more of an artbook with a few interviews here and there. But the quality of the book overall is top notch.   I always pick up these perfect catalogues when they get released in japan they finally released one for the ps2, these cover every ps2 game released in japan with some small info. So for a japanese import collector like me these are a must buy.   The persona/shin megami tensei and the wrestling with pixels ones are a no brainer if you are into either and like reading or discover more about the smt franchise or wrestling games. You can get them both from amazon and they aren't that expensive to get should you be interested.    The go straight is offcourse with 650 pages the ultimate book about side scrolling beat em ups, i always buy bitmap their books whenever they release a new one as they are the best when it comes to videogame books, always top notch quality and very well written, exellent lay out with huge ass pictures and whatnot and you know prices are reasonable for what you get.       now you know why i get up at 1.30 am at night to go to work.

Way of the samurai 3 i bought for the books suprised they managed to bother with a 350 page book for such a nice game :      More 360 shit,i bought a huge sports games lot back in august last year, since it was so cheap i went with surface mail. After 6 months i diden't count on it that it would still arrive so well you win some and lose some. Low and behold after 10 months in transit it arrived, i think even with shipping it was about 2 bucks per game considering wrestle kingdom sells for 20 alone and some games are going for around 10 i'd say that was a good deal and it saves me some pain to have to go trough a whole bunch of sport games, yes thats the pain of trying to get a complete collection :         Probably the best of the buch monster hunter frontier 2013 premium package, i've been searching for this ever since i knew of it existance and low and behold one showed finally up brand new, the good thing for me the guy listed under statues instead of games so i got it for about 3500 yen. Kinda hard to photography i always tought the dragon was plastic, but it's a stone book stand whoever thought it was a good idea to release this must have been high as fuck.   I wasen't really planning on getting a ps3 but one of my girlfriend her colleagues was getting rid of some stuff and they happened to have a barely used ps3 which she bought for 50 euros.      What can i say, getting that ps3 renewed my interest in the system so i got some japanese stuff for it that i've been meaning to get at some point. What can i say i love me some Idolm@ster , maybe i'll get around collecting ps3 one day 😁:    Hmm i guess that's everithing i got during may.   Edited June 6 by Yaramaki",2022-06-05T16:38:02Z

Got 2 of the rarest japanese 360 games knocked of the list and added a console i've been after for a while. I'll admit i kinda went overboard with bargain hunting for current gen stuff, what can i say i'm a sucker for a good deal and if stores slash their prices on a ton of games, this sucker will scoop up the things he has been holding off until they went on sale. Some games keep being brought up  here like hades and ghostrunner so i'm kinda curious if they are as good as some of you claim.         If you ask me what the rarest japanese xbox 360 game is,hands down it's going to be Bandfuse rock legends, i've been collecting japanese 360 stuff for a couple of years now and never seen it for sale once, i was starting to doubt that it even existed, low and behold a store on Yahoo japan shopping had a brand new one for sale with just a stock photo as picture for a decent price, i decided to take my changes and bought it and i'm glad i did turned out it exists. Disney fantasia is also one of the rarest 360 releases as it was the last kinect game released in japan, also came from that same seller.       Also yeah another console lol, Fist of the north star is my favourite anime of all time, so i had to get this special edition ps3 one way or the other. A seller on yahoo auctions japan was offering a brand new one for what i found a decent price, the guy was also nice enough to include a guidebook for the game. It's never been out of the box, like i'm i ever going to use it or take it out of the box probably not.

I've also changed the table cloth for the occasion 😉   Right where do i even start, let's start with the modern crap, couple of sales here and there you know the usual nothing too exiting, i did preorder endling - extinction is forever because not only it looks interesting but i also want to support smaller indie physical releases as much as possible + also the first switch game i bought this year. Damn thing is gathering dust like there is no tommorow (just kidding i dust it off every week) :      Japanese wii u, i had to get the zelda game at some point before they get really pricey so that's what i did, think i'm 2/3 done with set :      Japanese xbox 360 + since it's zelda month at my place, i diden't have the japanese version of wind waker and the zelda collection which was given out trough club nintendo, yep who still remembers club nintendo?      Japanese og xbox, i'm kind off hoping to complete this set by the end of the year and probably should be able to do it without breaking the bank. Anyway finally finally i got a minty copy of Dennou Taisen: DroneZ imo the rarest japanese xbox game, i've been searching for this game for let's say 3 years there is always something wrong with it, it's either faded or the manual is missing and when everihting is alright with it, sellers want 300+$ for it which eh  ain't going to pay that :          And we've saved the best for last this thing has been on my wanted lists for the longest time the Mobile Suit Gundam Warriors Kadokawa Shoten Special edition, which imo is hands down the rarest gamecube you can get since they only made 500 copies of it and were given away trough a lottery. I wasen't really planning on getting this but the opportunity came along to get a sealed copy from a collector who i haven't talked to in years, it's nice he remembered me and we quickly agreed to a price, which wasn't too bad let's say i could have bought a ps5 and a game for it, but eh why would i want that when i can have this instead.   I know you can get the regulair version of this game for 10 bucks or less, the only difference is the packaging and that you unluck everithing from the start of the game. Was considering of getting back into gamecube and pick where i left off a couple of years ago so i may just do that. Needless to say all this brings a huge smile on my face.          Edited July 26 by Yaramaki",2022-07-26T10:17:06Z

You don't bother to take the time to adequately read a post then without thinking it through you make a reply. The reply is clearly made with inadequate understanding of the post you are replying to and/or a lack of understanding of the facts and the subject matter of the thread itself. Then you say ""my bad"" and apologise. Then comes the part that genuinely pisses me off, you never learn form this when it happens and sooner or later you do exact same thing again. Why does this keep happening? Why is it despite making this mistake time after time, you keep doing it? Well, I'll tell you why, it's because you don't care. You don't care to put in the effort it takes to avoid making this mistake again, because reading and replying to posts with consistent accuracy on a forum does take effort. It takes reading a post carefully and making sure you understand it (Especially important if English isn't your first language.) then taking just as much care to crafting a reply that is worth making. But for you, getting this wrong is inevitable no matter how many times you ""apologize"" for it       And cherry on top of this shit cake is that in this thread, you are STILL getting it wrong! There's not one point in this entire thread @The Blackangel even mentioned the SNES or The Switch. Look again at her first post;        On 1/28/2022 at 6:20 PM, The Blackangel said:    NES games.

Noid Yoshi Zelda 2 The Adventure Of Link(gold)           Those are just some from my personal collection.         She even said in that post that that was only a potion of her NES games, another thing that needed repeated for your sake because you clearly didn't read it properly.       We know you're not doing this maliciously, but there has to come a point where you're not doing it by accident either. People who post on this forum, moderator or not, at the very least deserve to have people who read thier posts actually read them and understand them, especially if the one reading the post intends to reply. I really should not have to explain this to anyone because it's basic forum etiquette as well as common sense. It is so frustrating dealing with someone not understanding and replying to your clearly written, easy to understand posts because they can't be bothered to take the time to read them properly. I'd even call it infuriating. It would actually be better to ignore other people's posts completely than keep doing this.       Now, I really don't know where to go with you and the others who consistently do this sort of thing. Another thing I feel like I've said a million times, we understand that English is not the first language for a lot of our members, and if people do struggle with English we are here to help anyone needs help, but it's also true that it's each members responsibility to take the time they need to both read and write posts accurately. However, I tend to find that in most of these instances people tend to leave little time between posts, suggesting they are doing this in a rush.       If you keep doing this, we will have to take more affirmative action. We don't want your apologies @Justin11, we want to to learn from these instances.   Edited May 28 by Shagger         kingpotato, The Blackangel and Justin11        2          1",2022-05-26T22:24:10Z
