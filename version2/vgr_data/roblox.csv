https://www.vgr.com/forum/topic/14764-wishful-thinking/?do=findComment&comment=163564,14764,wishful thinking...,Yeah if they started making Nintendo games for PC we would be battling the costs of that and I don't wanna pay that kinda money to game. I like things affordable. Once in a while we get a pc game that slides our way. Some are ok. Some not so much. In one of the other threads they were discussing the game Stray. It may be coming to the Switch. They made a Myst game for the Switch but I could never figure it out so I gave up. I wonder if they were to take Roblox and make it for the Switch if the gameplay would be better? Roblox sucks on the computer.,2022-08-21T08:29:31Z,16

But, he's gradually getting into better games these days. 😄 I agree with him this writer though. Kids these days have really bad taste in video games, and like he said in the article, it could be because of popular kids youtubers who showcase these types of games. Hell, it's probably why the majority of these games are selling to this day. If no one was doing videos on Roblox, I bet no one would really be playing it.
