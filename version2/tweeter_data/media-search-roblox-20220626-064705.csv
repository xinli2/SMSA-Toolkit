1: A normal smile.
2: A normal frown.
3: A straight face with small puffed dimples. Ideal for Sunky lookalikes.
4: The smile of a skeleton whose creator loves him a little too much...
5: A ""Soyjak"" or ""Pogchamp"" mouth.
6: A huge grimace.
7: A comically angry, closed scowl.
8: That one mouth from Sonic Unleashed from in the game's beginning.
9: A huge, sharp-toothed grin. Perfect for those .exe creations of yours.",
