3_1536889726900256768,photo,"Gender fluidity refers to change over time in a person's gender expression or gender identity, or both. That change might be in expression, but not identity, or in identity, but not expression. Or both expression and identity might change together. In other words, a genderfluid person's gender identity can shift back and forth over time.
The colors in this flag are; pink for femininity, blue for masculinity, purple for both masculinity and femininity, black for the lack of gender, and white for all genders",
