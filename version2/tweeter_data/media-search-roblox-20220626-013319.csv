3_1537919727493820416,photo,"@Roblox if your are going to Perm ban me and my friends in the same exact day and time at least have a reason for it. I have gotten warned twice, But that was back in 2020 and as I know of I have never gotten banned for 7-14 days for doing anything harmful to your ""Community"" If your going to ban me give me a reason and I have been sending appeals to your email (support to be exact) and have still gotten no response in those ""10 business days"" I understand I might have of been ""Violating your terms of use"" but it's all in the photo you guys as in Roblox never gave me a reason on why I got banned. Thousands maybe millions of accounts are getting banned on your platform all because your company doesn't know what ""Communication"" is at least tell your players to stop. Give them warnings before your permanently take away that account the thrived for. Players spend hundreds on your game and they also farm games to get good in and you sit there and take it away in an instant. No communication",
