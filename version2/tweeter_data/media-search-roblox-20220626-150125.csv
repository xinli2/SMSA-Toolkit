3_1517693312089530368,photo,"The render showcases several armed prisoners battling against the law enforcement in front of the Jewelry store who are wielding Swat M4s and Pistols. While the Jetpack dude 1 blew up a police car, he decided to fire another rocket at the cops. The helicopter with a swat member is watching the chaos between the two teams. The prisoners have a Rhino tank and Thunderbird while the law enforcements themselves have Swat bearcats and basic Police cars. The scene takes place in the morning when they are battling against each other. Which either one of the teams would win, and the others shall fail. The artwork was made to show the support of the developers working on chapter 2 as it's currently still in development. As we wait patiently, I decided to make this render since I was bored and I think it's best to make something that I haven't done in a while. The effects are smoke/fog, lens flare, gunshots, some motion blur, and explosions. While the quality of the render was made with realism.",
