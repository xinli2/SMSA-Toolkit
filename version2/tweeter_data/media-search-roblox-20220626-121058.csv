I was just playing Pet Simulator X and I got kicked from the game, I thought it was my internet so I leave it there for a while and when I came back I realized nothing has changed and became worst so I checked my internet but it was completely fine, I also asked a few of my friends if the same thing is happening to them and they said that it says ""Something went wrong"" so I'm pretty sure it isn't my internet problem Roblox please fix this!
