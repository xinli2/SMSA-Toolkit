3_1522010990295977984,photo,"Hi Big Games, after the error of Roblox yesterday when I finally can play Pet Simulator X, I was so shocked that my blue big maskot is gone. I remember I equip it before the error of Roblox yesterday. I check my bank and my inventory, I still cant find my pet. I ask my friends if they have use my account but they dont know anything abt it, I already check their account too. My blue big maskot has 868 exist and now after i can log in back my roblox, it was gone. I dont know if it was dupe or not because it disappeared when it has exist. Big Games can you answer me?? Its was my roblox data has been deleted or it was dupe? If it was dupe why didn’t it say “Duped pet(s) has been found in your inventory” ????",
