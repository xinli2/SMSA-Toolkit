3_1521081917797400577,photo,"Basically i wanna remake the entire game due to the amount of unnecessary scripts and builds, and because that back then when I didn't really know anything about coding or building. I wanna try to atleast remake the map and add less endings, completely recode everything besides the packages delivery system. I feel like the entire game is just built off of entirely of references (mainly memes and games) and inspiration, which isn't bad. The game itself was inspired by @zachbealetv and @stixxal and @groovydominoes52. This game just feels off to me and i wanna make something i feel happy with, and atleast try to make the small community that i managed to get happy with the new changes.",
