3_1518385272823504896,photo,"The artwork showcases 2 cars: Dodge Hellcat and Porsche 911. The cars on the highway according to the background. In broad daylight, they start to do a race. The background is an afternoon sky with some clouds! The effects used here are smoke, lens flare, sun lens flare, directional blur, and glare. The edits have been passively edited so it would still stand out with some little changes. The Porsche seems blurred as their go-to high speeds.",
